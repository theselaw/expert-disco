>#### ---Theoretically : It's the study of computers including the hardware and the software ,a broad field that includes all aspect of computing including figuring out new ways to solve problems.

>#### Practically: It's simply about solving problems.

## -  Fields in computer Science

### 1. AI:  deals with the design of systems that can function without human control . Some examples of this are;(computer vs human )chess games, programs that suggests music based on listening interest.

### 2. UI(User Interface)/UX(User Experience ): deals with designing the interface people interact with--- these interactions can occur in different forms such as websites ,web apps , mobile phones ,VR (Virtual Reality ) e.t.c

>#### In this aspect of computer Science the designers takes into heavy consideration the usability and compatibility of their design , which requires attention to details , communication and collaborative skills. UI/UX Designers often have to collaborate with front-end and back-end engineers in order to have a finished product.

### 3. Data Science: Data Scientists mine large data to gain insights Or useful information. The ability to transform large amount of data into actionable insights can have a huge impact on a business, it requires attention to details , mathematics and analytical skills.

### 4. Software Engineering - Is a branch of Computer Science that enables the application of principles of Computer Science in order to design or develop software.

### Some things to explore outside the course are;
```
-What is a Computer System ?
-The Difference between computer hardware and software 
-Intensively and extensively discuss the difference between application software and System software.
-List example of application software and system software.
```

### Computer programming: also known as coding, involves wetting well structured instructions for a computer to execute.

>### *---a computer only understands machine language - which are zeros (0) and one's (1).*

### computer programs are written in a programming language ,However this does not mean that the computer can directly interpretes these programming language. This therefore takes us back to where we derailed from ---programming language

### ---programming language are divided into :
1.  Low level and
2.  High level language

### and subsequently the low level language is divided into two,which are ;

1.  Machine language
2.  Assembly language

### *Now let us break it down by explaining briefly;*

### Machine language: as formerly said can be directly understood by a computer

### Assembly language on the other hands needs to be translated by something called an assembler to machine language before it is understood by the computer. Assembly language is less complicated than machine language and it has some readable parts.

### High level language: on the other hand uses compilers and interpreters to translate it language into a machine readable language.

<br/>
<br/>

### *To illustrate how a computer program works,take for example you just woke up in the morning and would like to have a coffee first, a possible steps involved in achieving this would probably be in this form;*

```
-stand up 
-walk to your kitchen
-Boil water
-Add Coffee & Milk
-Yes Coffee is ready.
```
<br/> 

### *In the same manner computer programs are made up of sets of instructions which together fulfils the purpose of the program.*

<br/>

# chapter 3 - Compilers & Interpreters

### Compilers and interpreters both converts computer programs written in one language to another, usually a machine language and can be processed by a computer.

### However, While a computer translates the entire program at once . An interpreter on the other hand takes each of the statement in the program one at a time and translate.

>### A compiler is generally faster than an interpreter because it analyze each statement just once, while an interpreter must analyze it each time e.g in a loop .

<br/>

# Chapter 4 - Data and Information.

### Data:is a collection of values that can be symbols ,letters e.t.c

### Types of  Data

1. ### Digital 
2. ### Analog


### Digital : are programmed in a step by step sequence and jumps from one value to the next. They are discrete and discontinuous.

### Analog - are continuous and fluctuate infinitely within a range . E.g sound

>### Examples of some analog devices are: Loudspeaker , thermometer, NFC, amplifier e.t.c

### Data can be converted from digital to analog and vice versa using ADC (Analog to Digital Converter ) and DAC (Digital to Analog Converters).

### Information:- refers to the processed data . When data is interpreted, it provides context with which we can make informed decisions.


# Chapter 5 - Bits ,Bytes , Variables, Data types and Type Checking in programming.

![Bits ,Bytes , Variables, Data types and Type Checking in programming](https://github.com/theselaw/expert-disco/blob/week1/bits%20and%20bytes.png)
### Bits- This is usually denoted with a lower case of the letter   'b' , 8 bits is equal to a byte.It's also known as the smallest form of storage. This is seen more when describing network speed.


### Bytes:- are commonly used when referring to the size of data on a computer. For example when talk about the storage capacity of our gadgets phone or laptop say for example "my phone has an internal storage of 32 Gigabytes.".

>### 200Mbps (200 mega bits per seconds)<br/>It will take about 8 seconds to do download a file of ,since 1 byte = 8 bits

### Variables:are used to store data that is likely to be reused and or manipulated in a program, they provide a way of labelling data , so our programs can be understood more Clearly by the reader and ourself.

>### ---Think of a variable as a  data container, which you can call when you need the data that is in it.

### It is also important to use descriptive words when naming a variable as it gets difficult to manage obscure variable names in large programs.


### Assigning Values to Variables.

### In most programming language, the "=" equal sign is used to assign a value to a variable with the variable name on the left side of the operator and the value on the right.


### E.g
### Declaring a variable In python programming language is as follows;

```
Name = "Ade "
```
>### N.B :The operator in the context above is the "=" equal sign, also called the assignment operator . 


### Some language on the other hand comes with some keywords before a variable can be declared or assigned a value, an example of this is the JavaScript programming language :

```
Const name = "Ade"
```

### Data types :refers to the attributes of a value which provides the compiler on what types of mathematical, logical or relational operations can be carried out on it without throwing an error.

>### In simple terms ,It tells the compiler what type of data you're giving to it.

### Forms of data types;

1. ### integers
2. ### floating point numbers
3. ### boolean operatoes
4. ### Text/Strings
5. ### null
6. ### pointers.

### Integers:ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity,it includes negative numbers like -20 ,-4 ,-1 , Zero (0) and also positive numbers like 1 ,45 ,900 e.t.c

### Floating point numbers: includes numbers with decimals e.g 5.6 , 6.3 e.t.c

### Boolean operators -are used to operate conditions and to depict when something is either False or True.

### Text /String - represents words containing characters which may be made up of letters , digits , symbols and sign.

### null - represents an unknown or unspecified value.

### pointers - helps us store the memory address of a value

## Type Checking
>### Type checking involves ensuring that operations carried out on values of each particular data type in a computer program are valid .

### Type error: is thrown if an invalid operations is carried out.

### E.g

```
X = 4 *  "Ade tiger"

âˆš"Ade tiger"

```

## Methods of Type checking

1. ### Static
2. ### Dynamic

### Static: is done at a compiler time ,when a computer translates the source code.

### Dynamic:
