# Chapter 1- Welcome

### Front-end engineering can be thought of as an artist being able to draw an object such as a tree .

### As a front-end engineer you'll be able to convert designs into a website and web application.


# Chapter 2 - Hello and Welcome to Html .

### Html , CSS and JavaScript are core technologies used to build stuffs on the web .

### Front-end engineering among other technical aspects of it involves being able to convert designs into live websites or mobile and web application.

>### _N.B : The focus in this course however will be on website and web application._



# Chapter 3- What is Html  ,CSS and JavaScript ?

### HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language): is the markup language used to define the contents we display on a web page , they include paragraphs, images , titles ,headers e.t.c


### CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) : used in dictating or defining the appearance of the contents of a web page e.g making paragraphs framed, underlining paragraphs in a web page . It is simply used to define the appearance of the content that we create using html.

### JavaScript: This is also known as the programming language of the web . It is used to add interactivity to our web application or website.


>## To put it together, as an example;


<span align="center" style="color:yellow;">
-A form can be defined using HTML<br/>
-then centered with CSS</br/>
-While the input data can be collected,sent or kept somewhere using JavaScript.
</span> 





# Chapter 4. - How the Web works.

 >### When it comes to the web ,there are basically two things involved which are ;

## ---Clients (browser)

## ---web server

### Clients :also known as the browser is used ito type request for a resource using a link (URL) e.g say you're trying to visit a particular website.

### Webserver :Is where the particular resource say , website or webpage you are trying to locate is located or stored.


### (Uniform Resource Locator): is the link usually being typed in a browser in order to visit a site.

>### -Each URL points to a unique resource i.e website or webpages

>### ---It is an ID or unique address for a particular resource on the internet.

### An example of a URL is : altschoolafrica.com ,which leads to the website's home page.

### Resources required by a browser using a URL could be 
```
>>> websites (HTML document)

>>> Images (e.g Images seen on Facebook or Instagram)

>>> fonts , videos and audio files.
```
>### Each of the above listed resources as they may appear on any webpage or website has it own unique URL.

### Both the client and the web server communicates using a messaging  language known as the https -hyper text transfer protocol (secure).

>### In communicating ,The client sends a request to webserver in a bid to access a resource and when the receives this request,it checks it and then return a response to the client.

### DOM (Document Object Model): is the collection of all the contents inside a web page which could be images , videos ,fonts on a web page.

### The browser on the other hand is what constructs a these pages together such that it can be seen.

### For example let's say you have a blank book and a story to write ,the browser can be seen as the one writing the contents of the book and then showing it to you.



# Chapter 5- History of html
>## In 1989 ,Tim berners-lee invented what we know today as the web alongside this incredible invention which has helped shaped the word was the invention of its publishing language known today as HTML .

### Since it first creation it has evolved from its version 1.0 with limited tags and capabilities to now html with more abilities.

#### Later in the course we will be talking about 
```
-Anatomy of html elements
-Nestling elements
-Empty elements
-Anatomy of  html document
-images 
-comments
-links
-marking up text
-forms
-tables
```

# Chapter 6 -HTML basics
### **Html Elements:** are used to display contents in an html page in a desired format.

### E.g let us say we want to display a paragraph that holds the information "Hello World" in a web page. We can make use of the paragraph elements to achieve it in this manner:

```
<p> Hello World!</p>
```


### Anatomy of an Html element.

### An element basically has an opening tag , attributes , the contents to be displayed and a closing tag.

###E.g

```
<p class="text">My name is Maye</p>

```


Insert image here


### Html tags : are basically of two types an opening tag and a closing tag. They define the beginning and end of a web content or html element


### Attributes: are used to add extra (additional) information to an html elements which you don't want to appear in the actual content.It is placed in the opening tag.

>-Each attributes has a name and a value


Image



### ---It starts with the name of the attributes followed by an "=" equal sign or assignment operator to assign the value and immediately following the operator is the value.

>#### -Attributes have different properties and each serving different functions.<br/>
```E.g src , class ,alt ,Id```

### Src--locate the source of a file

### Alt - alternative text incase an image fails to display


### More of these attributes will be discussed in later lessons and in later lessons we will be diving into more html tags.

>### Conclusively, Front-end engineering can be thought of as an artist being able to draw an object such as a tree .
